Welcome!

This repository is a collection of focused projects that I've developed to explore various aspects of data science and programming. It includes a range of activities such as data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, implemented in SQL and Python.

What You'll Find Here:

Data Analysis: Projects that dive into datasets to uncover insights and patterns.
Data Visualization: Work focused on presenting data in a clear and meaningful way.
Machine Learning: Experiments and implementations of algorithms to solve problems.

Thank you for passing by!
